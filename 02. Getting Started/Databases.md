## What is Database?

A database is a structured collection of data organized in a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It is designed to efficiently store and retrieve large amounts of information, enabling users to perform various operations such as adding, modifying, deleting, and querying data.

Databases are used in many applications and industries, including business, education, healthcare, finance, and more. They serve as the backbone for storing and managing critical data such as customer information, inventory records, financial transactions, and employee details.

There are different types of databases, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, object-oriented databases, and more, each tailored to specific data storage and retrieval requirements.



## SQL vs NoSQL





| Aspect         | SQL                                                                       | NoSQL                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Structure | Structured (tabular)                                                      | Semi-structured or Unstructured                                                          |
| Schema         | Typically rigid schema enforced                                           | Dynamic schema                                                                           |
| Query Language | SQL (Structured Query Language)                                           | Various query languages or APIs                                                          |
| Scalability    | Vertical scalability (scaling up)                                         | Horizontal scalability (scaling out)                                                     |
| Transactions   | ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties supported | ACID properties may be relaxed for better scalability                                    |
| Relationships  | Relational databases support complex relationships between entities       | NoSQL databases may be schema-less or use alternative methods for handling relationships |
| Examples       | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle                                                 | MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis                                                                |
| Use Cases      | Suitable for structured data with complex relationships and transactions  | Suitable for large-scale applications requiring high throughput and flexible schema      |
